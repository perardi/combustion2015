			<p class="larger">Listed below are some of our favorite brunch spots in our neighborhoods. These are just a few of hundreds of brunch spots in the city. So you can go to one listed here, or try some other place your Aunt heard about a while back and regret your choice. Please plan on going right from brunch to the <a href="beach.html">Combustion Beach Party</a>. Bring your towels, speedos, sunscreen, and any other supplies/provisions with you.</p>

<p>If you are going in a large group (6 or more people) you MUST make a reservation, or else you will be waiting all morning and miss the beach. :(</p>

<p>Also restaurants in Chicago are big babies about splitting checks across multiple cards, even when there are only a 2 people! It is HIGHLY recommended to bring cash with you to brunch. However, paying for your trick's brunch is your choice.</p>
